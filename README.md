  This is the user-facing interface of the Smart Parking System.<br>
  It displays live information about available<br>
  and occupied parking spots, helping drivers<br>
  easily find a vacant spot.<br><br>

  <b>Key features shown:</b><br>
  ✅ Number of available spots<br>
  ❌ Number of occupied spots<br>
  🅿️ Total parking spots<br>
  📍 Real-time display of each spot’s status<br>

## 💡 Project Overview

This system performs the following:

1. Sensors placed in each parking spot detect whether the spot is occupied or vacant.
2. Sensor data is sent via ESP32 to a Fierbase cloud-based server.
3. The web application fetches this data and displays available spots .
4. Drivers can quickly find and navigate to available parking spots nearby.
