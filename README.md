## 💡 Project Overview

This system performs the following:

1. Sensors placed in each parking spot detect whether the spot is occupied or vacant.
2. Sensor data is sent via ESP32 to a Fierbase cloud-based server.
3. The web application fetches this data and displays available spots .
4. Drivers can quickly find and navigate to available parking spots nearby.
